# Event Driven Architecture 

**Q1**:What is Event Driven Architecture ? 

**Solution**:

Software Design pattern that enables applications and systems to communicate by producing , detecting and reacting to events .Components automatically respond whenever an event occurs leading to faster , more scalable and loosely coupled systems 

**Q2**:What is loose coupling in EDA ? 

**Solution**:

Loose Coupling ➡️

- Producers (sources of events) and consumers (services that react to events ) are independent of each other 
- This allows services to be updated , scaled or replaced without affecting the rest of the system 

**Q3**:Key features of EDA 

**Solution**:

- Loose coupling 
- Scalibility and Flexibility 
- Real time processing 
- Resilience and Fault Tolerance

**Q4**:Common use cases of EDA 

**Solution**:

- Real time data processing
- Serverless workflows
