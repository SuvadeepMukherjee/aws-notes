# Fundamental Cloud Concepts

## What is Cloud Computing ? 

- Cloud Computing 
  - The on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing 
- Benefits of Cloud Computing
  - Cost Effective
  - Scalable
  - Reliable
- Major Cloud Providers 
  - Amazon Web Services 
  - Microsoft Azure 
  - Google Cloud

## Deployment Models : Public , private and hybrid 

- Cloud Deployment Models 

  - The various ways cloud computing services are deployed and made available to users 

  - Cloud deployment models offer different levels of control and customisation over our cloud infrastructure 

  - Deployment Models 

    - Public  Cloud 

      - Cloud resources are owned and operated by a third party and services are delivered over the internet 
      - Available to multiple tenants (user)
      - Leverages a pay-as-you-go system
      - Easily accessible and no up-front infrastructure investment
      - Examples - Amazon Web Services , Microsoft Azure . Google Cloud

    - Private Cloud 

      - Dedicated to a single organisation and hosted on-premises or by a third party 
      - Offers more control , security and customization options
      - Can be implemented within an organizations data center or remotely managed 

    - Hybrid Cloud 

      - Combines elements of both public and private clouds 

    - Public vs Private Cloud 

      | Private Cloud              | Public Cloud                                 |
      | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
      | Store sensitive data       | Performing generalized tasks                 |
      | Perform regular operations | Perform operations when there is high demand |

  

## Service Models 

Cloud  Service Models 

-  Refers to the differnt levels of management and abstraction provided by Cloud Service providers 
- Types of Service Models
  - Iaas( Infrastructure as a service )
  - Pass (Platform as a service)
  - Saas(Software as a service)

## Iaas(Infrastructure as a service)

- Provides  virtualized computing resources over the internet, including servers , storage and networks 
- Have control over Operating Systems , applications and development frameworks 
- Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud

## Paas (Platform as a service)

- Provides a platform allowing customers to develop , run and manage applications without having to deal with the underlying infrastructure 
- Provides tools , libraries and development environments to streamline the application development process
- Users can concentrate on building , deploying and managing applications without worrying about servers , storage or networks 
- Heroku , Amazon amplify and Google App Engine 

## Software as a service(Saas)

- Delivers ready-to-use software applications over the internet accessible via web browsers or APIs
- No installation or maintanence needed 
- Provides pre-built software applications accesible through a browser
